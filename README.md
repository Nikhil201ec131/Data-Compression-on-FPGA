# Data-Compression-on-FPGA
Implemented Data compression on the FPGA using Verilog Hardware description language. Created a Verilog model for two kinds of lossless data compression algorithms i.e Huffman compression and Shanon fano algorithm. Compared the performances of the algorithms used and finally implemented the Huffman algorithm on the FPGA board.
